<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Here are a few useful examples of how PEC-CHAT can be used:

2)Message Requests: To maintain privacy, PEC-CHAT users can receive message requests from users they don't follow. This enables users to accept or decline chat invitations from unknown individuals.

3)Professional Networking: PEC-CHAT's chat feature is geared towards professional networking. Users can connect with colleagues, peers, mentors, and potential employers through direct messaging.

4)Attachments and Links: Users can share attachments, such as resumes, portfolios, and relevant articles, within their messages to provide context and information.
